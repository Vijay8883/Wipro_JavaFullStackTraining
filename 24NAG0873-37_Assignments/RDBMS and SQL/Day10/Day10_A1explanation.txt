1. *BEGIN Transaction:*
   To start a transaction, use the BEGIN statement. This ensures that subsequent SQL statements are part of the same transaction:

   sql
   BEGIN;
   

2. *INSERT New Record into 'orders' Table:*
   Assuming you have an 'orders' table with columns like 'OrderID', 'CustomerID', and 'OrderDate', you can insert a new record like this:

   sql
   INSERT INTO orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate)
   VALUES (12345, 'CustomerXYZ', '2024-05-21');
   

   Replace the values with actual data.

3. *COMMIT the Transaction:*
   After successfully inserting the record, commit the transaction to make the changes permanent:

   sql
   COMMIT;
   

4. *UPDATE the 'products' Table:*
   Let's say you want to update the price of a product. Here's an example:

   sql
   UPDATE products
   SET Price = 49.99
   WHERE ProductID = 1001;
   

   Adjust the column names, values, and conditions as needed.

5. *ROLLBACK the Transaction (if needed):*
   If something goes wrong and you need to undo the changes, use the ROLLBACK statement:

   sql
   ROLLBACK;
