 Let's create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a hospital management system. I'll start by identifying the relevant entities, relationships, attributes, and cardinality. Then, I'll ensure that the diagram reflects proper normalization up to the third normal form (3NF).

### Entities:
1. *Patient*: Represents an individual who receives medical treatment.
    - Attributes: PatientID (Primary Key), Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Contact Number, Address
2. *Doctor*: Represents a medical professional.
    - Attributes: DoctorID (Primary Key), Name, Specialization, Contact Number
3. *Department*: Represents different medical departments within the hospital.
    - Attributes: DepartmentID (Primary Key), Name
4. *Appointment*: Represents a scheduled appointment between a patient and a doctor.
    - Attributes: AppointmentID (Primary Key), Date and Time, Status (e.g., confirmed, canceled)
5. *Prescription*: Represents medication prescribed to a patient.
    - Attributes: PrescriptionID (Primary Key), Medication, Dosage, Frequency

### Relationships:
1. *Attends*: A patient attends an appointment.
    - Cardinality: Many-to-One (Many patients can attend one appointment.)
2. *WorksIn*: A doctor works in a specific department.
    - Cardinality: Many-to-One (Many doctors work in one department.)
3. *Prescribes*: A doctor prescribes medication to a patient.
    - Cardinality: Many-to-Many (A doctor can prescribe multiple medications, and a patient can receive prescriptions from multiple doctors.)

    Patient ||--o{ Appointment : "attends"
    Doctor ||--o{ Department : "works in"
    Doctor }|..|{ Prescription : "prescribes"
    Patient {
        string PatientID
        string Name
        date DateOfBirth
        string Gender
        string ContactNumber
        string Address
    }
    Doctor {
        string DoctorID
        string Name
        string Specialization
        string ContactNumber
    }
    Department {
        string DepartmentID
        string Name
    }
    Appointment {
        string AppointmentID
        datetime DateTime
        string Status
    }
    Prescription {
        string PrescriptionID
        string Medication
        string Dosage
        string Frequency
    }


### Normalization:
1. *First Normal Form (1NF)*:
    - All attributes are atomic (no multi-valued attributes).
    - Each attribute contains only a single value.
2. *Second Normal Form (2NF)*:
    - All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
    - No partial dependencies exist.
3. *Third Normal Form (3NF)*:
    - All non-key attributes are transitively dependent on the primary key.
    - No transitive dependencies exist.
