Here we have the SQL statements to create a new database,the tables reflecting the library schema, and some modifications using ALTER and DROP.
These statements will setup your library system with the neccessary tables and relationships.
The ALTER TABLE statements are used to modify the structure of the tables after they have been created,and the DROP TABLE statement is used to remove a table that is no longer needed.Always ensure to back up your data before making structural changes to your database.
